# Movies Search App

This app allows users to search for movies, view information about them, and save them to a "Watchlist." Users can search for movies by title, view the search results with detailed information, and add movies to their "Watchlist."

## Features:
- **Movie Search**: Type a movie title in the search field, and the app will suggest autocomplete results.
- **Display Movies**: The search results are displayed as cards with the movie title, image, and release date.
- **Movie Details**: Clicking on a movie card opens a modal window with detailed information about the movie (rating, runtime, cast, etc.).
- **Add to Watchlist**: You can add movies to your watchlist. The list is stored in the browser's local storage, so the movies remain even after the page is refreshed.
- **Sort Movies**: You can sort movies by popularity, release date, or rating.
